{"title": "Bright, comfortable 1-bed flat - SUBLET FROM 7 Oct. ALL BILLS INCLUDED", "price": "\u00a31,800", "body": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\n***Available now -  \u00a31800 PCM all inclusive***\n\nI am offering my one bed flat for sublet whilst I spend time in the countryside. It is tastefully furnished with everything you need for a comfortable stay including bedding, towels, toiletries, basic food needs, wifi, landline, central heating, washing machine, Alexa, and a Nutribullet too. The only thing it doesn't have is a TV and parking in the area is permit only during the weekdays. My cleaner will also attend the flat once a week to take care of the basics including ironing. \n\nI would prefer just one or two people in residence. The flat isn't massive (it does have high ceilings) so it starts to feel a bit crowded if there are too many people. Very happy for viewings in advance and/or to share identify documents as I am aware this website has some fraudulent listings. \n\nRent is not negotiable as I am only charging my costs and making no profit on it.
