It has a front and rear garden, lounge, dinning room, broadband and Netflix etc (bills included). I am a working professional and only home a few hours in the evening. You'll pretty much have the house to yourself.\n\nAlso, I can provide and travel assistance within reason. As I'm now working from home, I can be your driver if you need to get to a train station or need help with shopping etc.\n\nFeel free to message me for more pictures and further details.\n\nMutual agreement only.\n\n(Please only serious offers and no timewasters.)
