Ideally the room will be an en-suite (although this is not a deal breaker). It must be a double room. I am looking for somewhere within zones 1-2 and no farther than zone 3 please. I am also open to hearing from people who have a 1 bed flat to offer. I am not looking for a short term let. I am not looking to share a room.\n\nA bit about me: I am a PA and self employed beauty therapist, in my mid 20's, Black British. I Currently work from home quite a bit (can do so from my room as all i need is my laptop) so wouldn't socialise too much during the week. I am happy to share dinner and a glass of wine in the evenings, with more socialising on the weekends. \n\nSince we are still in the midst of a pandemic i don't tend to have many guests, but you must be comfortable with me having guests (all in adherence to government guidelines of course) for movie nights/dinners which you'd be welcome to join. \n\n\nRent: I can offer around \u00a3700 pcm (not set in stone) this is of course dependent on the standard of the home/room. I can also go higher if you have a 1 bed to offer!\n\n\nIn your response please give me clear details about the room (photos would be amazing), rent expectations, bills and availability. A few basic details about yourself would also be helpful.\n\nWe can talk on the phone and video-chat before meeting for the actual viewing. This should be enough to confirm that we are bith who we say we are and the room actually exists!\n\n:D xx    ", "post_id": "7253184196", "created_time": "2020-12-28T00:08:33+0000", "modified_time": null}
