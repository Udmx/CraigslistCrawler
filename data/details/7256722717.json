Struggling with rent and work during these weird times... Not really looking for freebies and am happy to pay rent as soon as I'm working and standing on my own 2... \nI'm super loyal, friendly and protective of kind people \n\nLonley since covid but usually social \n\nI don't do drugs or drink, used to be a stoner but now I only smoke cigarettes but am giving that up too... I'm very clean, a bit too much at times, I'm 26.\n\nIf you're gay, thats cool but I'm not about that and I'm not sending nudes.\n\nIv worked many jobs, can plaster, paint and decorate... Was also a bartender. \nHit me up if you think we can help each other out =)    ", "post_id": "7256722717", "created_time": "2021-01-04T16:09:11+0000", "modified_time": null}
