Unfortunately due to the circumstances it's a little difficult to keep staying with my extended family and waiting this out in a hotel is a bit out of my price range. I'm hoping I could pay about 100 a week for just a room in London somewhere ideally near transit? I know I'm asking a lot since it's an expensive city and I don't know exactly how long it will take to make my way home.\n\nThanks for reading\n-Tanya    ", "post_id": "7252026781", "created_time": "2020-12-24T19:05:07+0000", "modified_time": null}
