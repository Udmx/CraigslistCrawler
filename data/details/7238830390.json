I'm a nonsmoker.\n\nIdeally I'm looking to share with one or two other gay guys who are easy-going, social and chill. Open to living with a nudist/naturist. Only nonsmokers, please. \n\nI can have a flexible moving date. Please feel free to ask any questions over email. Cheers,\n\nSam    ", "post_id": "7238830390", "created_time": "2020-11-29T18:50:12+0000", "modified_time": "2020-12-29T17:35:35+0000"}
