{"title": "Female offers housework to ladies in exchange for room", "price": null, "body": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\nDisclaimer: this is about housing and personal connection, NOT about adult services, thanks.\n\nI've been and worked in London for quite a bit and I find myself in need of a place to stay. I would like to offer cooking and housework to a female household in exchange for a small room.\nThis is also a bit about personal connection because I am platonically drawn to women and would really love to look after a young lady as a domestic help, just for the joy of being useful to someone I care for.\nSo far I have worked for families so this personal inclination hasn't found a venue.\nI cook everything and like to vary every day, iron and clean very well, and I'd be happy to run errands.\nI'm healthy, clean, referenced, and asexual, so once again please NO soliciting that kind of services (feel free to waste your time trying).\nThis would be ideal for an educated young lady who appreciates a devoted help, or a female household with a room to spare.\nI will reply to all genuine enquiries, thank you.
