{"title": "Need a Room", "price": null, "body": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\nI am a black lady looking for a room ideally in zone 2 or 3. I have a budget so if you have a room that you know is expensive then please don't offer it to me. It has to be my own room, not looking to share. \n\nI am not doing anything intimate or etc, so don't come to me with that. I already live somewhere so I'm not desperate just want to see if I can go cheaper.\n\nIdeally I want to move at the end of January or sometime in February. So, I am getting a head start.\n\nPlease dont waste my time or yours, just tell me the location and the price in the first email.
